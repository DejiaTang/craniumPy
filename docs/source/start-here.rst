Cranium is most easily installed using `pip`_, Python's package installer. However, Cranium's dependencies can be difficult to install using pip, so we recommend that you install `Anaconda`_ to manage more complicated packages. See `python set up`_ for more details.

	pip install cranium

If you're new to scientific computing with Python, we recommend that you install `Anaconda`_ to manage your Python installation. Anaconda is a framework for scientific computing with Python that will install important packages (`numpy`_, `scipy`_, and `matplotlib`_) that cannot be easily installed with `pip`_, which is the build in Python package installer.

.. note:: Cranium is written in Python 3, so we recommend that you install the Python 3 version of Anaconda.
